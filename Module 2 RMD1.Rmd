## R Markdown

# This is a level 1 header

### This is a level 3 header


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. 

Here is a link to [GOOGLE](https://www.google.com/)

Here is a word in **bold** and another word in __bold__.

Here is a word in *italics* and another word in _italics_.

When we compile our document, we are using the `rmarkdown` package (highlight).

Here are some example R commands:

```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5)) Put in box; This is text in box, not code
```

Here is an example of a non-numbered list:

4 spaces for indent and 8 for double indent with symbols - understand

* Breakfast
    - food
        + eggs
        + toast
        + bacon
    - drink
        + apple juice
* Lunch
    - taco
* Dinner
    - baked chicken
    - broccoli
    - rice


Here is an example of a numbered list:

1. Breakfast
    a. food
        i. eggs
        ii. toast
        iii. bacon
    b. drink
        i. apple juice
2. Lunch
    a. taco
3. Dinner
    a. baked chicken
    b. broccoli
    c. rice

Here is an example of a blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
> 2. Second item.


Here is an example of a nested blockquote: Another way to put in a box with nesting where there is a space between two greater than symbols

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> > This text is nested


Here is an example of code in a blockquote: leave 5 spaces

>     2+2
>     mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Each code chunk must have a name like below is r cars

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure10, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r pressure2, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
plot(pressure)
```


## Insert Tables
See Knitr packages for outputing tables

```{r table1, results = 'asis'}
knitr::kable(head(cars), 
             caption = "Top Six Rows of CARS", 
             align = "r", digits = 1)
```

## Insert an equation

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x - \alpha - \gamma x^{2n}  $$
$$ Y = \int\limits_0^1  x dx $$
$$ Y = \prod_j \sum_{i=1}^n x_{ij} $$

## Insert Images

Here is an image inserted

Here is the R logo

## Insert an Animated GIF and Video

## Insert text with some footnotes

Here is a footnote reference [^1] and another [^longnote]

Here is an inline footnote ^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the note.]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.
[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.
